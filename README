We share a multi-subject and multi-session (MSS) dataset with 122-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) signals collected from 32 human participants. The data was obtained during serial visual presentation experiments in two paradigms. The dataset of the first paradigm consists of around 800,000 trials presenting stimulus sequences at 5 Hz. The dataset of the second paradigm comprises around 40,000 trials displaying each image for 1 second. Each participant completed between 1 to 5 sessions on different days, lasting approximately 1.5 hours of EEG recording. The stimulus set used in the experiments included 10,000 images, with 500 images per class, manually selected from ImageNet and PASCAL image databases. The MSS dataset can be useful for various studies, including but not limited to (1) exploring the characteristics of EEG visual response, (2) comparing the differences in EEG response of different visual paradigms, and (3) designing machine learning algorithms for cross-subject and cross-session brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using EEG data from multiple subjects and sessions.
